# npc-room

A simple web application for a visual conversational "home base," intended to supplement tabletop games.

This is a DEMO ONLY, which means you get to add your own character sprites and faces.

The look and feel of this demo is designed to be ambiguous in terms of sci-fi, modern, or fantasy setting.

# Features

* Web page with a bunch of NPC images on it.
* The NPCs cycle through conversation lines when you click on them.  They remember where they left off.  The conversations loop.
* NPC faces show up on their textbox.
* NPC names show up on their textbox.
* Textboxes fade after a certain period of inactivity.
* Textboxes can render HTML formatting.
